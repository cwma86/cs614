    "# CS 614 Assignment 3: NLP\n",
    "## News article classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pitch: \n",
    "In a previous project I develop a Stock viewing website (https://mauer-stocks.azurewebsites.net/), with the goal of creating future stock price predictions in effort to make better investmant decisions. I have a theory that being able to automatically read in breaking news articles and classify wether they shed a positive or negative light on a given stock will enable me to make more accurate price predictions. The goal of this assignment is leverage a news article API and build a model that can classifiy the stories as positive/negative for future use as a model feature or engineered features that can be used to improve stock price predicitons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source:\n",
    "For this project I chose to build my own dataset, leveraging the newsapi (https://newsapi.org/docs/client-libraries/python) via this homebrewed python script(https://github.com/cwma86/cs614/blob/main/nlp_assignment/pull_descriptions.py) for pulling news articles for various stock ticker and storing them to a sql database. Once the stories were stored to the database they were manually labeled with the assistance of this python script (https://github.com/cwma86/cs614/blob/main/nlp_assignment/label_data.py) which provided a simple human interface. \n",
    "The final data set resulted in 416 positive and 268 negative articles for various stocks over the last 1.5 months. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model and data justification:\n",
    "For building the model I chose to leverage a deep learning model that leveraged tensorflow/keras functionality. The largest issue with the model is it's simplicity, which was required to reduce overfitting between the test/train datasets due to the small data set of only 700 articles. Additionaly it would likely be benificial to move from a LSTM to a Transformer layer which has shown to have better success than LSTM due to language structure not following a purely temporal structure.
